# GB300 Multicore - port of multicore from SF2000
This repo is a fork of original work done for [Multicore for SF2000](https://github.com/madcock/sf2000_multicore) handheld. All credits go to those folks working on the multicore. 

This fork especially would not be here if it was not for the amazing work of [Osaka @ RetroHandhelds discord](https://discord.com/channels/741895796315914271/1195581037003165796/1232748087714250894).

# How to install
- Download the latest release of GB3000 Multicore from [release tab](https://github.com/tzubertowski/gb300_multicore/releases)
- Backup your SD card
- I highly recommend to install bootloader fix via [SF2000 Tadpole](https://github.com/EricGoldsteinNz/tadpole/releases) (it works just as well on GB300)
- Unzip the release directly on GB300 SD card

Multicore otherwise works the same as it does on SF2000, so you can reference the [source](https://github.com/madcock/sf2000_multicore).

## Using cores
- drop a rom, of a game you own, into roms/{EMU} folder of the SD card
    - eg. I would drop pokemonFireRed.gba into roms/gba
- run make-romlist.bat (or sh for linux)
- put the card back into GB300, turn the device on
- navigate to roms, select your game, enjoy the experience

## About the platform
More information about the GB300 handheld gaming system can be found [here](https://nummacway.github.io/gb300/).

## Status
Some cores build and work well, others build and have issues (no sound, slowness, etc.), some build but do not currently work, and others do not build at all. For current information on the state of each core, please see the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BDPqLwRcY2cN7tObuyW7RzLw8oGyY9XGLS1D4jLgz2Q/edit?usp=sharing).

## Releases
Multicore releases can be found here: https://github.com/madcock/sf2000_multicore_cores/releases

## Setup (before building)
### Via docker
As I'm using Windows as my main machine, I have added a simple docker-compose file that spins up a tiny ubuntu server

Prereqs:
- docker
- docker-compose

Simply run
> docker-compose up -d

To ssh into the container
> docker exec -it compiler-server /bin/bash
> cd app

### On the linux machine
(This is the top level project, forked from: https://gitlab.com/kobily/sf2000_multicore)
- choose a directory to contain all this
- decide if you want EVERYTHING (there are a lot of cores!)
    - YES, I want ALL the cores!
        - `git clone --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules https://github.com/madcock/sf2000_multicore`
        - wait for a long while
    - NO, I want to select individual cores
        - `git clone https://github.com/madcock/sf2000_multicore`
        - `cd sf2000_multicore/libs/libretro-common`
        - `git submodule update --init .`
        - `cd ../..`
        - choose a core to grab, for example, picodrive
        - `cd cores/picodrive`
        - `git submodule update --init .`
        - repeat this process for as many cores as you want
    - Note: libretro-mrboom takes a very long time to receive, even with `--shallow-submodules`, so I guess be patient!
- from the top level of this repo, install the compiler tools
    - `./install-toolchain.sh`
- copy the 08/03/2023 (official release 1.6) file
    - `cp <YOUR_1.6_BISRV.ASD> bisrv_08_03.asd`
 
## Building
If setup properly, there are a few ways to build.

If all the core sources for working cores are available:
- `./cleancoresworking.sh` to clean only working cores
- `./buildcoresworking.sh` to build only working cores

Or use the scripts to clean and build all the buildable cores:
- `./cleancores.sh` to clean all cores
- `./buildcores.sh` to build all cores

If only some of the core sources are available:
- edit the Makefile as necessary to point to the core(s) you want to build
- the Makefile must include one entry for `CORE` and one for `CONSOLE` with an optional `MAKEFILE` entry
- the easiest thing to do is just uncomment a single core

Optionally, use the Makefile.everything:
- uncomment a single core, as described above
- `make -f Makefile.everything`

All of the cores are independent.

## Updating
- update EVERYTHING from the top level of this repo:
    - `git pull --recurse-submodules`
    - wait for a while
- you can still pull from individual directories (like a core), as usual, but you may want to grab submodule updates too:
    - `git pull; git submodule update --remote`

## Discussion

## Notes
This repo was forked from the official repo in github that kobil maintains at https://gitlab.com/kobily/sf2000_multicore
I will try to keep things here in sync.
